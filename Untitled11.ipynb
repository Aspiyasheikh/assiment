    "Ans: An ensemble technique in machine learning is a method that combines the predictions of multiple models (called base learners) to create a stronger overall model. The idea is that a group of weak or average models can perform better when combined than any single model alone.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are three main types of ensemble techniques:\n",
    "\n",
    "‚úÖ Bagging (Bootstrap Aggregating) ‚Äì Trains models independently in parallel and averages their predictions (e.g., Random Forest).\n",
    "\n",
    "‚úÖ Boosting ‚Äì Trains models sequentially, where each new model focuses on fixing errors made by the previous ones (e.g., AdaBoost, XGBoost).\n",
    "\n",
    "‚úÖ Stacking ‚Äì Combines predictions of multiple models using a meta-model that learns how to best blend them.\n",

    "Ans: Bagging (short for Bootstrap Aggregating) is an ensemble technique in machine learning used to reduce variance and prevent overfitting.
